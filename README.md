# Mesolite
A generic cross-platform c++17 API for interfacing with several protocols utilized by video games.

Why use Mesolite over X?
* Mesolite is capable of easily being compiled into a minimal binary that is tailored to your project, only implementing the API components and subystems you decide to utilize.
* Mesolite is truly cross-platform.
* Mesolite easily supports adding your own backends. This is useful if you ever need to port your project to a video game console.
